## Summary
In this project, we are mapping earthquakes over the past week. There are three maps to choose from: streets, satellite, and dark. There are also three overlays to choose over the map: all earthquakes, earthquakes over a magnitude of 4.5, and the tectonic plates.

The following is the result of all the files in the Challenge folder. The other files are used to help learn about leaflet and how to branch and merge on github.
